Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <img src="sahijlogov2.svg" alt="python" width="400" height="400"/>

These are some of my personal projects! 
I have 3.5 projects currently available. 
and will update regularly. 

All projects on this GitHub are my own work. 

- A script that takes PDF statements from bank account and imports numerical data into Excel.

-   (automates book-keeping from credit card website -> excel)
  Parameters need to be adjusted to select import/export locations.
   (guide will be added shortly)

- AMU firmware (and probe firmware) 

- AMU rotation calculator tool 

- a dump of some of my non-proprietary and semi useful 3d designs

 Thanks for stopping by!!
 ðŸ™Œ
